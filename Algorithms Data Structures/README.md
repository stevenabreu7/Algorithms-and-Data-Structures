An implementation for a singly linked list in Python.

## 04 Recursive Lists
An implementation for a recursive list in Standard ML.

## 04 Orders
An implementation for a sorted list (Order) for the smaller-equal order on integers, the lexicographic order on string and the divisibility order on integers.

## 05 Sorting of Integers
Various algorithms for the sorting of integers: bubble sort, counting sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort.
